I'm sat writing this blog post about 4 months after writing my [2021 kick off blog post](/blog/cloud-with-chris-moving-forwards/). My aim for 2021 was to focus on one goal - contributing back into the technical community.

{{< tweet 1345748585443454978 >}}

I set out 2021 to achieve 500 subscribers by the end of the year, and had ideas of creating brand new types of content. When I created Cloud with Chris back in March 2020, I started it off as a podcast. Later in 2020, I decided to add the video content to the mix. Then, as we entered 2021, I brought my old blog posts from my personal website onto Cloud with Chris, and started off a weekly blog.

I then began the journey of evolving my content over time, by -

* Introducing additional series of content, including Tales from the Real World, Cloud Gaming Notes and Cloud Drops
* Automating as much of my processes as possible, including uploads of the podcast MP3s to Azure Storage, cross-posting to Twitter and Reddit (though more work to be done here), dev.to and medium.com
* Kicking off a weekly vlog (Yes, there have been 20 of those so far!)
* Starting off releasing a weekly blog, but now adjusting to a cadence of producing two blog posts per week (This is blog post #25 from 2021!)
* Bringing more guests onto the show, and making the sessionize more discoverable to bring in a diverse and global set of guests
* Improving upon the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of the website to increase the audience that are accessing the content.

All of that effort has clearly been worth it! Over the weekend (I believe 15th May was the date), I managed to hit the magic 500 subscribers mark on YouTube, **way** ahead of schedule.

So, a big heart-felt thank you from me for everyone that has taken time to either read, listen or watch my content, become a guest on the show, or provide any guidance, coaching, or feedback to help me get to where I am.

The journey is not over, and I've got plenty of ideas and energy to take me forwards to the next 500 additional subscribers. There's a ton of content in the pipeline, with a backlog of guests for me to respond to that would like to join the show!

Who knows, maybe we can reach 1,000 subscribers by the end of 2021? That would be awesome!

So, please stay tuned for more to come very soon. As always, I deeply appreciate the feedback as I continue making my content even better than it is right now.

Onwards and upwards! Bye for now.
